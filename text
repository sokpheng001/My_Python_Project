In this example, the echo and surround modules are imported in the current namespace because they are
defined in the sound.effects package when the from...import statement is executed. (This also works
when __all__ is defined.)
Although certain modules are designed to export only names that follow certain patterns when you use
import *, it is still considered bad practice in production code.
Remember, there is nothing wrong with using from Package import specific_submodule! In fact, this is
the recommended notation unless the importing module needs to use submodules with the same name from
different packages.
